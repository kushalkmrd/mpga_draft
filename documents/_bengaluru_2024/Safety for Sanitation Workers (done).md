**Safety And Living Conditions of Pourakarmikas**

Sanitation workers, or "Pourakarmikas" form the last mile of Sanitation
facilities provided by the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) in Karnataka. They
are at the frontline of keeping our cities clean, habitable, and
pleasant. However, they are also subject to harrowing work conditions
and are often perceived as doing indignified work. The social stigma
working against sanitation workers has grown along with lack of
investment in their well-being and work conditions.

Most face health issues, as seen in Table 1, most of which would be
solved with simple personal protective equipment. There have been empty
platitudes of providing safety gear and gloves, yet most collect waste
with bare hands. The working conditions are inhumane, without access to
clean drinking water, changing rooms, or washrooms. [In addition to the
stigma and indignity]{.mark} [associated with sanitation workers, there
is the additional burden of caste discrimination -- about]{.mark}
[three-fourths of the Pourakarmikas are Dalits, along with garbage
collection loaders and]{.mark} [unloaders. These issues, while appearing
to be individual failures of the ULBs belie a deeper]{.mark} [systemic
issue -- the casualisation of work.]{.mark}

>
> [A fair wage structure must be established, recognizing the similarity
> in work across all sanitation]{.mark} [workers and reducing
> unacceptable wage gaps. Contract workers, who lack benefits
> despite]{.mark} [equal work hours, are especially vulnerable.
> Immediate steps must be taken to issue payslips and]{.mark} [wage
> books to all workers, with surprise checks on clerks to ensure
> compliance.]{.mark}
>
> [Local leaders should regularly confer with sanitation workers to

> [Adequate facilities such as first aid, drinking water, clean toilets,

> particularly for women workers. Maternity, paid, and medical]{.mark}
> [leave must be enforced, with penalties for non-compliance by private

> [Daycare centres should be established to support working mothers.
