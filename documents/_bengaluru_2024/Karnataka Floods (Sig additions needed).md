**Issue Brief: Floods**

On 21^st^ May 2023 a 22-year-old girl working for Infosys in Bengaluru
got trapped in a flooded underpass at KR Circle in a car with a few
other people. While everyone was rescued and rushed to St. Martha's
hospital, the girl did not survive. The city's drainage systems were
unable to deal with the excessive rainfall, especially in heavily
constructed, low-lying areas. Bommanahalli and Mahadevpura, which house
the tech cluster in the city.

96 lives were lost since the month of June across the state of Karnataka
due to floods, according to reporting by The Hindu in September 2022, as
many as. The state of Karnataka suffered total damages of Rs. 9,833
crore and Rs. 1,975.81 crore during the year 2020 and 2021 respectively
due to heavy rains and floods, according to an answer by the then
Minister of State for Jal Shakti Shri \[??\] in the Rajya Sabha in
August 2023. The increase in the number of incidents due to heavy rains
and floods is alarming and highlights the critical need for improvements
in flood management and damage mitigation across Karnataka as well as
India.

These increasing accidents have drawn attention to the absence of good
quality drainage infrastructure and the way we deal with floods. The
following short-term and long-term solutions can be considered:

> ● Update and determine the flood profile for the high flood levels
> from the T drainage study and new surveys or contour maps to plot the
> extent of flood levels along the waterways.
>
> ● Use GIS based technology to develop a spatial database with web
> based information systems, which can be used by
>
> ● Separation / relocation of the sewage system from the stormwater
> system. This can be done by establishing a coordinating committee/task
> force between BWSSB and BMP to coordinate these issues and to
> undertake an option study (risk, cost, constraints) to identify the
> preferred option to separate the two systems.
>
> ● Enforce / develop planning laws on illegal connections of sewage
> system and stormwater system
