**Issue at Hand: Gig Workers\' Employment Status and Their Rights**

The online gig economy in India, which includes platforms like Uber,
Zomato, Ola, and Swiggy, has grown significantly in recent years. As of
2020-2021, India had an estimated 7.7 million gig workers, according to
a [report by the [NITI
Aayog]{.underline}](https://www.niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2022-06/Policy_Brief_India%27s_Booming_Gig_and_Platform_Economy_27062022.pdf).
This constitutes around 1.5% of the total workforce in the country. The
same report projected that the gig workforce would expand to 23.5
million by 2029-2030, accounting for about 4.1% of total employment in
India​. However, gig workers are classified as independent contractors,
not employees, denying them basic protections like social security,
accident compensation, health insurance, and union rights.

Moreover, recent studies reveal severe concerns about the welfare of gig
workers. The [[Fairwork India Report
2023]{.underline}](https://fair.work/en/fw/blog/fairwork-india-report-2023-examining-working-conditions-of-workers-on-digital-labour-platforms/)
highlights that most digital platforms fail to provide gig workers with
fair pay, adequate safety measures, or collective bargaining rights. A
study by the [[National Council of Applied Economic Research
(NCAER)]{.underline}](https://www.ncaer.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NCAER_Report_Platform_Workers_August_28_2023.pdf)
shows that the real incomes of gig workers have decreased between 2019
and 2022, with rising operational costs (like fuel) exacerbating the
situation. Despite some state-level progress, such as the [[Rajasthan
Platform-Based Gig Workers
Act]{.underline}](https://prsindia.org/files/bills_acts/acts_states/rajasthan/2023/Act29of2023Rajasthan.pdf),
workers across the country remain vulnerable, lacking social protections
and a safety net.

**[Current Legal Framework]{.underline}**

> 1\. [**[Social Security Code,
> 2020]{.underline}**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1944372):
> This code recognises gig and platform workers as formal employees,
> envisioning schemes for social security, health insurance, and
> disability coverage. However, [[these provisions have yet to be
> enforced]{.underline}](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1983590),
> and gig workers still lack formal employee status​.
>
> 2\. **Collective Bargaining**: Gig workers are excluded from the
> protections of the [[Trade Unions Act,
> 1926]{.underline}](https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/13322/1/trade_unions_act_1926.pdf),
> meaning they [[lack formal union rights and collective bargaining
> power]{.underline}](https://aicctu.org/workers-resistance/v1/workers-resistance-jan-2023-special-issue/defrauded-and-disorganised-gig-workers-india).
> Without the right to organise or negotiate, workers are vulnerable to
> unfair wage practices and arbitrary penalties imposed by platform
> companies​
>
> 3\. **Workplace Safety and Compensation**: Unlike factory workers
> covered under laws like the [[Factories Act,
> 1948]{.underline}](https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/1530/1/A1948-63.pdf),
> gig workers are not entitled to workplace safety provisions or
> compensation for work-related injuries under the [[Employees\'
> Compensation Act,
> 1923]{.underline}](https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/11221/1/employees_compensation_act%2C_1923.pdf)

**[Proposed Solutions: Addressing the Key Issues]{.underline}**

> 1\. **Formal Employee Status**: Reclassify gig workers either as
> employees or create a new legal category that ensures access to
> minimum wages, paid leave, accident insurance, and social security
> benefits. This would help reduce income volatility and improve job
> security​.
>
> 2\. **Mandatory Health and Safety Regulations**: Enforce health and
> safety standards for gig workers, akin to the provisions in the
> Factories Act, to ensure safer working conditions. This would include
> mandatory accident insurance, health coverage, and rest periods​.
>
> 3\. **Collective Bargaining Rights**: Amend the Trade Unions Act to
> allow gig workers to form unions and engage in collective bargaining.
> This would provide them with a platform to negotiate better wages,
> fair working conditions, and protection against unfair dismissals​.

**[Legal Route: Learning from European and Indian
Examples]{.underline}**

> 1\. **United Kingdom:** [[Uber vs. Aslam
> (2021):]{.underline}](https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2019-0029.html)
> The UK Supreme Court ruled that Uber drivers must be classified as
> \"workers\" rather than independent contractors, granting them minimum
> wage, paid leave, and the right to unionise. This landmark case shows
> how the reclassification of gig workers can significantly improve
> their working conditions​.
>
> 2\. **Spain**: [[Riders Law
> (2021):]{.underline}](https://osha.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2022-01/Spain_Riders_Law_new_regulation_digital_platform_work.pdf)
> Spain's Riders Law mandates that gig workers in food delivery be
> treated as employees, giving them access to unemployment benefits,
> paid leave, and social security​.
>
> 3\. **Rajasthan Platform-Based Gig Workers Act, 2023**: In India, the
> state of Rajasthan has passed [[the Platform-Based Gig Workers
> Act,]{.underline}](https://aioe.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Gig_Workers_Bill_2023_1690274461.pdf)
> which requires all gig workers to be registered and provides a Welfare
> Fund for their social security. This Act sets an important precedent
> for improving the welfare of gig workers in India, although its
> long-term success and nationwide scalability remain to be seen​.

**[Application for India: Case Studies and Benefits]{.underline}**

**Falling Incomes and Rising Costs**: The [[NCAER
study]{.underline}](https://www.ncaer.org/publication/socio-economic-impact-assessment-of-food-delivery-platform-workers)
shows that between 2019 and 2022, gig workers' real incomes decreased
while their operational costs rose. This trend highlights the urgent
need for regulatory reforms to protect gig workers from further
exploitation​.

**Accident Fatalities**: Cases such as the [[death of a Zomato delivery
worker in
Hyderabad]{.underline}](https://www.siasat.com/zomato-delivery-boy-dies-in-road-accident-in-hyderabad-compensation-demanded-3094686/)
demonstrate the severe lack of compensation for work-related injuries
and fatalities, further underlining the need for mandatory accident
insurance​.

**Health Risks**: Gig workers, particularly delivery riders and drivers,
face long hours, physical strain, and road accidents[[. Uber and Ola
drivers have reported working over 12 hours
daily]{.underline}](https://scroll.in/article/926146/overworked-and-underpaid-indias-gig-workers-are-survivors-of-a-flawed-economy)
to meet trip incentives, often without health insurance or compensation
for work-related health issues.

**[Benefits to the Public]{.underline}**

Implementing these reforms would not only protect gig workers but also
improve the overall quality of services provided by these platforms.
Safer working conditions and fair wages will lead to a more motivated
and productive workforce, ensuring better customer service and more
sustainable growth for the gig economy.

**Summary: List of issues and concerns**

**Status of Social Security Code, 2020**: An update on the
implementation of the Social Security Code, 2020, with a focus on gig
and platform workers, is required. This includes progress on draft rules
in various States, current developments in social security schemes, and
the role of the Centre for Labour Studies, NLSUI. Information on
challenges, timelines, and efforts to increase awareness among gig
workers should be provided.

**Legal Reforms for Unionization**: Clarify the government's position on
legal reforms akin to the UK's Uber ruling or Spain's Riders Law.
Details are needed on potential amendments to labour laws for
unionization, support for collective bargaining, and the expected impact
on workers and platform companies.

**Addressing Costs and Incomes:** Outline the measures being taken to
address the declining incomes and rising costs for gig workers. This
includes proposed support programs, regulations to control operational
costs, and steps to ensure stable income. Ongoing research and
collaboration with industry experts to address these challenges should
be detailed.

**Regulations for Platform Companies:** Provide details on planned
stricter regulations for platform companies to ensure compliance with
labour laws. This encompasses fair pay, safety measures, transparency in
reporting, and penalties for non-compliance. Support mechanisms for
companies to adapt to these regulations should also be included.

**Comprehensive Strategies for Gig Workers:** Present the government's
comprehensive strategy to address gig workers\' needs, covering
employment status, social security, and workplace safety. Effective
coordination among government agencies, identification of policy gaps,
and continued engagement with stakeholders for ongoing improvements are
essential.
