**Issue Brief: Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS) and Adjunct Laws**

**Background**

-   The Bharatiya Nyaya (Second) Sanhita, and Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha
    > (Second) Sanhita came into effect on 1 July, 2024 after being
    > passed by the Parliament in December 2023 to replace the Indian
    > Penal Code, and CrPC respectively.

```
-   The Three Criminal Laws were bulldozed through Parliament while 141
    > opposition MPs were suspended, which is against parliamentary
    > procedures and integrity.

-   The period of consultation and scrutiny for the three bills was
    > woefully short, and stakeholders and civil society members were
    > excluded. This resulted in poor quality of the drafting of these
    > bills, and ambiguity in the law.

**Highlights**

-   The BNS2 removes sedition as an offence. The provisions on
    > endangering the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India have
    > retained aspects of sedition.

-   The BNS2 retains the provisions of the IPC on rape and sexual
    > harassment. It does not consider recommendations of the Justice
    > Verma Committee (2013) such as making the offence of rape gender
    > neutral and including marital rape as an offence.

-   The BNS2 omits S. 377 of IPC which was read down by the Supreme
    > Court. This removes rape of men and bestiality as offences.

**New Provisions**

-   [BNS: Community service is now a punishment for offences such as:
    > theft of property worth less than Rs. 5,000, appearing in a public
    > place intoxicated etc.]{.mark}

-   [BNSS: All trials, inquiries, and proceedings may be held in
    > electronic mode. Production of electronic communication devices,
    > likely to contain digital evidence, will be allowed for
    > investigation, inquiry, or trial.]{.mark}

-   [A complainant may approach any police station irrespective of
    > territorial jurisdiction to file an FIR. (173(1) BNSS). For crimes
    > that are punishable by jail terms between 3 and 7 years, police
    > have the discretion to conduct a preliminary inquiry for 14 days
    > before the FIR is filed.]{.mark}

  Recommendations                                                                                 Whether incorporated in
                                                                                                  BNS2
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------
  Rape (IPC s.375) -- Any non-consensual activity of a sexual nature should be included in the    No. Original provision
  definition of rape. Exception to marital rape should be removed.                                retained in Clause 63.

  Words, gesture, or act intended to insult modesty of woman (IPC s.509) - the section should be  No. Original provision
  repealed. The offence of 'eve-teasing' can be charged under s.354 of the IPC (s.73). Remove the retained in Clause 79.
  terminology 'modesty of women' from the IPC.9                                                   

  Assault or use of criminal force on woman with intent to disrobe (IPC s.354B) - penalty should  No. Penalty is
  be increased to imprisonment for at least five years up to 10                                   imprisonment for at
  years.[\[19\]](https://prsindia.org/billtrack/the-bharatiya-nyaya-second-sanhita-2023#_edn19)   least three years up to
                                                                                                  seven years (Clause 76).

  Adultery (IPC s.497) -- the section violates Articles 14 and 21. It creates a distinction       Yes. Adultery has been
  between men and women based on gender stereotypes, and is arbitrary. Justice Verma Committee    omitted. However, BNS2
  suggested removing Adultery as an offence. The Standing Committee on Home Affairs suggested     retains s.498 of the IPC
  making Adultery a gender-neutral offence.                                                       which penalises a man
                                                                                                  for enticing the wife of
                                                                                                  another man so that she
                                                                                                  may have intercourse
                                                                                                  with any person.

| IPC  | The Supreme Court read down Sec 377 to exclude consensual sex |
| sec  | between adults. This meant that forced intercourse with an    |
| tion | adult male is an offence, so is intercourse with an animal.   |
| 377  |                                                               |
|      | The BNS2 does not retain section 377. This implies that rape  |
|      | of an adult man will not be an offence under any law, neither |
|      | will having intercourse with an animal. The Standing          |
|      | Committee on Home Affairs (2023) has recommended              |
|      | re-introducing this provision.                                |
