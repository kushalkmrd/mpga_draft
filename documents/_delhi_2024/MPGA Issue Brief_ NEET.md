**MPGA Issue Brief: NEET-UG conducted by National Testing Agency (NTA)**

**Overview**

-   The NEET-UG 2024 situation while the case is being under
    deliberation by the honourable supreme court, there are critical
    questions on the state of past and future of NEET-UG exam that need
    to be known for the benefit of nearly 20 lakh students that give the
    exam every year.

-   Tamil Nadu's NEET Opposition: Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin
    has opposed NEET, citing concerns about its impact on educational
    equity and social justice. They constituted a committee, and the
    Rajan Committee\'s findings support this stance.

-   NEET UG is closely tied to the functioning of National Testing
    Agency (NTA) which administers most central examinations leading to
    admission in undergraduate courses.

-   NTA's failure over the recent months with NEET UG concerns and
    inadvertent postponement of UGC-NET raised critical questions on the
    structure, functioning and resources that NTA has to conduct exams
    in a fair, efficient and transparent manner.

### National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET-UG)

-   NEET UG was first implemented in 2013, intended to replace various
    state and college-level entrance exams.

-   The exam was designed to bring uniformity, transparency, and
    fairness in medical admissions.

-   Initially conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education
    (CBSE), NEET is now administered by the National Testing Agency
    (NTA).

#### Tamil Nadu's Opposition

The state\'s opposition is rooted in concerns about educational equity
and social justice, which were highlighted by the findings of a
high-level committee led by Justice A.K. Rajan. The committee\'s
extensive analysis highlighted the adverse effects of NEET on various
student demographics within Tamil Nadu​.

**Rajan Committee Findings**

-   Post-NEET, there has been a marked decline in the number of students
    > from rural areas, Tamil-medium schools, lower-income families, and
    > state board schools securing admissions in medical colleges.

-   The proportion of Tamil-medium students admitted to medical colleges
    > dropped significantly from 14.88% in 2016-17 to between 1.6% and
    > 3.27% after NEET was implemented​​.

-   The share of rural students in government medical colleges fell from
    > an average of 61.5% pre-NEET to 49.91% in 2020-21.

-   Students from higher-income families saw an increase in their share
    > of admissions, while those from lower-income backgrounds
    > experienced a decline.

-   Students from CBSE schools gained a distinct advantage over those
    > from Tamil Nadu state board schools. The share of state board
    > students in medical college admissions fell from 95% pre-NEET to
    > 64.27% in 2020-21, while the share of CBSE students rose from
    > 3.17% to 32.26% during the same period​​.

-   [The committee reported that nearly all the students who secured
    > admissions in 2019-20 had received coaching for NEET, which keeps
    > the admissions dependent on expensive coaching beyond the regular
    > school.]{.underline}

#### 2024 NEET Controversies

The NEET UG 2024 is an evolving situation as the Supreme Court is
currently hearing multiple petitions and the status of the exam may
change. The following are the major highlights of the concerns

-   Nearly 24 lakh students gave the NEET UG examination, the results
    were released on June 4th 2024, much before schedule and many
    students were surprised over the inflation of marks.

-   An unprecedented number of perfect scores and a significant rise in
    high scores.

-   Grace marks led to improbable scores for many candidates (which is
    now resolved with a new exam for the concerned as ordered by the
    Supreme Court)

-   Several anecdotes of cheating, paper leaks, and other irregularities
    were raised and investigated by state police in Bihar and Gujarat.

-   A large increase in high-scoring students (that can secure a
    government seat) raised questions about the exam\'s integrity.

-   NTA's head was dismissed from the position in June, few weeks after
    the NEET exam results were announced.
