**MPGA: National Budget 2024 Demands**

India today is witnessing stark jobless growth -- especially amongst
young graduates, the unemployment rate stands at 43%, and overall at
6.5% this fiscal. For a country looking to cash in on the Demographic
Dividend, these are worrying numbers. Inflation and price rise are also
the urgent issues of the moment.

    > the Kothari Commission (1984) that the government increase the
    > allocation for education exp. to 6% of GDP.]{.mark}

2.  [The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance led by Jayant Sinha
    > in February 2024 recommended a reduction of the GST rates on
    > insurance products, especially health and term insurance, which is
    > 18 per cent at present. Insurance companies as well are seeking a
    > reduction in GST rates on life insurance products to 12%. The
    > rationalisation of GST applied on intermediate and finished goods
    > is also necessary.]{.mark}

3.  [In February, a Parliamentary Standing Committee recommended that
    > the wages for MGNREGA labourers should be at par with agricultural
    > wages and should be at minimum ₹375 per day across all states.
    > There is also a need to review and track the devolution of MNREGA
    > funds to State Governments. Many State Governments have raised the
    > issue of delayed payments for MNREGA over the past few
    > years.]{.mark}
