**Status of Infrastructure and call for an engineer certification**

The current state of public infrastructure in India, marked by recent
incidents of bridge and airport ceiling collapses, reveals a dire need
for a national regulatory body to certify civil and structural
engineers. The lack of standardised training and certification leads to
underqualified engineers handling critical projects, posing significant
safety risks.

We need to understand the reasons and points of failure to address these
critical infrastructure failures, to prevent any more incidents. A
proposed Bill aims to establish rigorous national standards and a
regulatory body to ensure only competent engineers oversee
infrastructure projects, thereby enhancing public safety and trust.

The solution to the problems in quality introduces a Bill to establish
national standards for individuals involved in building infrastructure
across our country.

# **The Issue at Hand:** Absence **of comprehensive** national guidelines that determines the qualifications of experts across the civil engineering fields has led to inconsistencies and risks in large-scale infrastructure and development projects. Post graduation, there are [no established standards]{.underline} for quantifying and validating the skills, experience and credentials for engineers.

# **Proposed Solution:** We propose the establishment of a nationwide regulation system for engineers. It would involve a body that comprises [experienced engineers with a standardised process]{.underline} of interviews or examinations to certify independent professional engineers across various disciplines. Such a system will ensure that only highly qualified and thoroughly vetted engineers are entrusted with critical infrastructure projects.

# **Legal Route to Address the Issue:** The introduction and enactment of [a Civil Engineer\'s Bill]{.underline}, modelled after the Architect\'s Act, 1972 (Act No. 20 of 1972), will provide the legal framework necessary to [formalise qualifications, certifications, and professional standards for engineers]{.underline}. This Bill will mandate the creation of a regulatory body to oversee the registration and certification process, ensuring consistent application of standards nationwide.

# **Benefits to the Public:** Implementing this Bill will enhance public safety by ensuring that only the most qualified engineers oversee our infrastructure projects. This will prevent incidents of substandard engineering and promote trust in our public works. It will establish a transparent and accountable system, replacing the existing local-level authorization and empanelment of engineers and reassuring the public of the competence and reliability of the professionals responsible for their safety.

# **Why hasn\'t there been action so far?** Gujarat is the only state that has an exam based professional engineer registration in place with the [[The Gu]{.underline}j[arat Professional Civil Engineers Act, 2006]{.underline}](https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/4585/1/professionalcivilengineer.pdf) and many other states have only a simple experience and professional degree-based certification and empanelment that could be easily exploited by the cash-rich real-estate developers and contractors. There is reluctance as the power and final authority on approval of buildings can move away from the developers.

# **Civil Engineering Disciplines:** {#civil-engineering-disciplines .unnumbered}

> **Geotechnical Engineering (Soil Engineering):** Ensures the stability
> and integrity of structures by analysing soil and rock mechanics.
>
> **Structural Engineering:** Focuses on the design and analysis of
> buildings, bridges, and other structures to ensure they can withstand
> various forces.
>
> **Surveying:** Involves the measurement and mapping of land to ensure
> accurate construction and legal property boundaries.
>
> **Transportation Engineering (Highways and Trains):** Deals with the
> planning, design, and operation of transportation systems to ensure
> safe and efficient movement of people and goods.
>
> **Environmental Engineering (Water Supply and Waste Management):**
> Manages the design and implementation of systems for clean water
> supply and waste disposal.
>
> **Hydrology (Dams and Irrigation Channels):** Studies the distribution
> and movement of water resources to design effective water management
> systems.
>
> The urgent need for this Bill cannot be overstated. Every day,
> millions of our citizens rely on the safety and integrity of our
> infrastructure. From bridges and highways to dams and buildings, the
> risks posed by unqualified individuals masquerading as experts are too
> great to ignore. It is our duty to ensure that our infrastructure is
> built and maintained by the most capable hands. This Bill is not just
> about regulations; it is about safeguarding lives, ensuring the
> longevity of our infrastructure, and restoring public confidence in
> our engineering standards.
>
> The Architect\'s Act, 1972 (Act No. 20 of 1972), serves as a precedent
> for this initiative. This Act regulates the profession of architecture
> by establishing standards of qualifications, registration, and
> professional conduct. Similarly, the proposed Engineer's Bill will
> institute rigorous standards and a regulatory body to ensure that all
> engineering practices meet the highest standards of safety and
> expertise.

We urge all Honourable Members to support this initiative for the
betterment of our nation\'s infrastructure and the safety of our
citizens.
